          <h2>The most important questions</h2><br>
          <p>We thought about a way to improve the understandability of our website and the functionalities.
			 Below you can find the most important questions. But do not hesitate to ask if you want to. 
			 Just use the adress given in „Company Information“.<br></p>

              <h4 class="slider2">What is "Semvis-Air"?</h4>
              <p>„Semvis-Air“ is a german abbreviation and stands for „<b>S</b>ystem zur <b>Erfassung</b>, <b>M</b>odellierung und <b>VIS</b>ualisierung der Luft“ 
			  and can be translated as a system for capturing, modelling and the visualisation of the air. This system addressed to veryone, 
			  who wants to know something about the quality of the air someone ist breathing. The user optimised user interface makes 
			  it easy for people who are not familiar with web applications. Our detailed help (where you are at the moment) hopefully 
			  supports you but do not hesitate to ask if something is unclear. Just use our mail-address in “Imprint and Contact”.

              <h4 class="slider2">What is an “Air Quaility Egg”?</h4>
              <p>An “Air Quaility Egg” (AQE) is an egg-shaped object and includes different kinds of sensors. A complete AQE consists of 
			  two components: the remote station and the receiving station. Former includes the sensors for the measurements and is 
			  usually attached somewhere outside within the reach of the receiving station. The transfer of the data is conducted automatically. 
			  The receiving station is connected to the internet and is thereby able to send those data in real-time to Cosm for visualisation. 
			  Currently the communication is conducted through Ethernet but a connection with the help of radio-frequencies is planned. 
			  By default an AQE includes several sensors, in detail: temperature, humidity, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
			  Ozone sensors for example can be added optional. 
			  </p>
            </li>
            <li class="slider1">
              <h4 class="slider2">What is Cosm?</h4><p> 
			  Originally Cosm was named “Pachube”. It started in 2009 with an idea of establishing a network for sensors. In this network 
			  it should be possible to add data and to use data from others through an API for own applications. Semvis-Air is such an application. 
			  Cosm offers the possibility to get an account. Such an account provides the opportunity to comment, follow and add new sensors. 
			  Latter just requires a connection to the internet and you can start. The transfer and visualisation of the data are resumed by 
			  the Cosm-system. This circumstance makes it easy for beginners to be part of the network. The data is stored and available 
			  for three months.  			  
			</li>
            <li class="slider1">
              <h4 class="slider2">How do I use the functions in the map?</h4>
              <p>The map contains information about the position of the Air Quality Eggs. All the measuring devices are selectable. 
			  A click on one of them opens a pop-up containing the name, time information and the measured values. Let us assume 
			  that you want to have a detailed view on the previous values. Just click on the desired AQE and use the “Select”-Button. 
			  The name of the selected AQE will appear on the left below “Selected Eggs”. It is possible to choose up to three different devices. 
			  Now you can choose one of the two visualisations “Table” and “Diagram”.

              <h4 class="slider2">Wie nutze ich die Funktionen von Semvis Air in der Tabellen- und Diagrammansicht?</h4>
              <p>Test test test</p>
            </li>
            <li class="slider1">
              <h4 class="slider2">Which measured values can I see?</h4>
              <p>Following values are measured by the instruments and considered on our page:
					1) Temperature
					2) Humidity
					3) Carbon Monoxide
					4) Ozone
					5) Nitrogen Dioxide

				In the map view on the button on the left you can see the “official values”. These values contain reference values for 
				the measured values with the exception of carbon monoxide. We added fine dust (PM10) as a further interesting measuring 
				value but it is not measured by one of the devices. These values refer to the whole of Münster. Ozone, fine dust and 
				Nitrogen Dioxide are measured by “Lanuv”, the state office for issues concerning nature, environment and consumer protection. 
				Temperature and humidity are obtained by the study group Climatology. These official values should help to evaluate the 
				measured values and also give you an orientation.

            </li>
            <li class="slider1">
              <h4 class="slider2">What a significance do the values have?</h4>
              <p>Carbon Monoxide is a toxic breathing gas that constrains the oxygen transport in our circulation. But the concentration 
			  decreased that much, that even in high frequented streets measured values are beneath critical values. High ozone values 
			  have a negative effect on the pulmonary function and the immune system. Tiredness and headache can follow. The critical value of 
			  ozone is 180µg/m³. Nitrogen Dioxide is also a gas and tends to result in irritations and illnesses of the air ways. 
			  Its critical value is 200µg/m³. Fine dust (PM10) expresses the mass  of suspended particles in the air. It arises from motor 
			  activity or similar proceedings. Problems with the cardiovascular system are possible health effects. The critical value is 50µg/m³ 
			  and should not be exceeded more than 35 times.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="slider1">
              <h4 class="slider2">Where are the measured values from?</h4>
              <p>The measured values in the pop-ups, the table and the diagram are delivered by the Air Quality Eggs. It is important to consider, 
			  that the quality of the data depends on the proceeding of the owner. It might be, that some of them do not attach the remote device 
			  in the right way. Some are not (as suggested) installed outside. Instead they are somewhere inside a house but such approaches do not f
			  deliver representative measurements.</p>
